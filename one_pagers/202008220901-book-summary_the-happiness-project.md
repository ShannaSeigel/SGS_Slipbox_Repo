*Summary by Summerian; shared for free to Habitify users.*

### Impression:
If the real book is as vapid and blind to privilege as the summary, I'm glad I didn't read it. It sounds like the author digs into stoicism and happiness but the summary does not reflect this at all. **My time would probably be better spent going back to the source material from Aristotle and other authors.**

### Points of Note/Personal Reactions:
- We often plan for goals and success but not for happiness.
- Being happy is as important and respectable a goal as being a great leader, rich CEO, whatever.
- A whole chapter on how being sick makes you unhappy? 
	- I'd like to believe the argument here is to prioritize our sleep and health so that we are better able to engage with life and happiness. 
	- This also veers into how being tidy will make you happy and that you can attack clutter one item at a time
		- Pretty sure Marie Kondo has me covered here
		- Same applies for work and GTD principles
- Arguments that relationships bring happiness. 
	- Shower loved ones with kindness
		- Also everyone? You don't need to love someone to treat them with kindness or compassion.
		- Maybe this is where the love languages book comes in
	- Bringing happiness to others is where you will find happiness
		- Same argument from Headspace
- Chapter on work and passion, they don't have to be exclusive
	- isn't that everyone's holy grail of work/life balance or perfect career choices that somehow we have to decide before we're barely considered adults? 
		- We're always changing. So isn't it possible the perfect career or life decision is going to change constantly? 
	- Advises exploring what you like to do in your spare time and if you find it fun. Could it be your job?
		- Feels overly simplistic and full of privilege. I'm sure my mom opted to work in box factory on night shift because it was "fun."
	- Says results are often the goal for people because it gives a purpose or motivation. These goals can also be a burden that leaves people under constant pressure.
		- I think this might actually be a worthwhile point. I constantly lament that I'm not good at my job because the visible, tangible result tends to be paperwork. I hate and suck at paperwork.
		- It also speaks to the idea that we (I) focus on external/physical goals far more often than internal ones. I may have goals for skill development, which is great and excites me, but how often is that pushed aside for mundane stuff? And how often in our society as a whole do we push aside internal work as something negative, for special people in therapy or SJWs (still don't see how that's bad), etc.?
- Money and happiness; argues money does not bring happiness but it helps
	- Fuck off
	- It's okay to splurge on novelties or things you love and value. Sure, but this is stated as if everyone has the option. Who is the target audience here? See points below.
	- For me, this brought up issues of how we, in the US at least, do not prioritize "pursuit of happiness" for all our citizens. That includes happiness brought through financial stability. We're completely fine with or blind to the class systems and the widening class gaps that leave more and more people suffering in poverty, without access to health care, healthy food, education, and much more. A country truly dedicated to the words of the founding fathers would promote those social goals rather than just rich white people. BUT, those same men were rich, white people that owned slaves, sooo... maybe we have different ideas of what equality looks like.
- Mentions that ideas are best addressed when they are born and applied in reality, rather than keeping them in your head.
	- I guess? I'm not sure why this was in the money chapter?
	- Back to points behind GTD, PKM, etc. These philosophies are about getting thoughts out of your head and into a space you can see, analyze, and implement.
- Mindfullness. Sure. Yes. Again, better sources out there I bet.

## Ideas of Value
It's very possible the book is actually well researched and nuanced so I'll cut the author some slack. For me, this summary highlights some of my core values and that's worth exploring.

- Happiness comes in small moments with people and ideas we value
	- This includes, and maybe should be the primary goal, making time to value the happiness of others
	- Internal happiness is not exclusive to the mind. Prioritizing sleep, health, and mindfulness all contribute to better mood. This can look like lots of things, including how we maintain the spaces we inhabit. Is it the right level of tidy? Is it conducive to sleep? etc.
- The happiness of others on a community level and national level is not black and white or easily achieved through quick solutions. This requires me and others to truly explore our values as human beings and find ways to create EQUITY. The pursuit of happiness as a national value/basic right means people need physical, emotional, and financial stability. 
- On a personal level, goals don't always need to be tangible, visible results or products. They can be internal goals like learning and skill building. They can also ask the larger question about "will this make me happy?" or "how does this lead to happiness?" However happiness is defined in that situation. It's not that different from "will this lead to the outcome I want" but the outcome can be more targeted to our emotional selves and not just "achieve X output."

### Other resources that might underscore/expand ideas:
- Marie Kondo and tidying our physical lives to lift the burden on our minds
	- Totally felt this was helpful after running this experiment in Arizona. I'd like to run it again but I think some will have to wait til we actually move
- Aristotle (I think?) on stoicism
- Philosophies of knowledge management and "getting things done"
- Headspace meditations, including those on happiness
- Possibly the "Love Languages" book(s)
- US Constitution. I've never read it in full

[[../../âœ… Task List]]: Expand some of these ideas on core values
