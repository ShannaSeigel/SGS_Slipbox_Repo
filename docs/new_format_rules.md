### Format Requirements for Web Sharing
1. File names MUST be a single string with no spaces in order to create links.

2. Stick to lowercase text in naming because links are case-sensitive.

3. Wikilinks `[[notes with double brackets]]` are not a standard markdown tool.
	- Use standard link format with `[anchor text](link location)`

4. REMEMBER NOT TO MOVE/RENAME folders or files unless I plan to update all links. Obsidian will auto update links for wikilinks but NOT classic/normal link format.
