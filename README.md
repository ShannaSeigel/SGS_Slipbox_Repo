# My Slipbox Repository
Through GitHub Pages I'm testing out the idea of my own online knowledge repository.

*Update Nov-2020*

I'm attending the [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/) workshop and would like to compare hosting my notes through Obsidian Publish and GitHub Pages. I'm working out the details but they should end up with the same content available. Check out [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) here.

I started learning about personal knowledge management a few years ago and I've thought about an online version of my knowledge files for a while. Once I saw people sharing their digital gardens (which is a concept I'm still exploring) I thought I'd join in on the fun!

I jumped on Obsidian train in Spring 2020 but I've used plenty of other programs in the past. I had been using [Bear](https://bear.app/) for several years since it's very easy to work with and I could export any of my notes as text or markdown files. Ideally I want my documents to be independent of any specific software though so I'm transitioning to markdown.
