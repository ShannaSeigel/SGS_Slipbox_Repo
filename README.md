# SGS_Slipbox_Repo
## Shanna's Private Repository for my ZK

Reference for self with a log of my findings.

- Created Obsidian vault just from this folder as the root folder that will be shared to GitHub.

Link test:
[zk note test](202008231210 zk note.md)
This link appears in the note's local graph in obsidian. Works just fine. 
Guess what, I broke rule #1, don't fucking have spaces. This link is broken in GH.

Second try
[no spaces link](202008231216_link_to_me.md)
