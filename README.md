# My Slipbox Repo
Testing out a repository for my ZK/garden/second brain/what-have-you

## Plan for SGS_Slipbox Files
- Need to review incoming files from my existing notes for formatting requirements regarding filenames and links.
- Make sure to maintain this structure going forward.
	- Can use the "relative notes" setting to quickly get file names from wikilinks. Can edit link formatting after.
- Goal to keep list of zettels in a flat, single folder in hopes of reducing broken links.
- Non-knowledge-base files can live in another folder for easy access.
	- Though this will require me to think about link formats.
- Still mulling over how to handle organization, landing page, blog, or anything else I'd like to add.
