# My Slipbox Repository
Through GitHub Pages I'm testing out the idea of my own online knowledge repository.

I plan to share files from my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault as I create them. I started learning about personal knowledge management a few years ago and I've thought about an online version of my knowledge files for a while. Once I saw people sharing their digital gardens (which is a concept I'm still exploring) I thought I'd join in on the fun!

I jumped on Obsidian train in June (I think) but I've used plenty of other programs in the past. I had been using [Bear](https://bear.app/) for several years since it's very easy to work with and I can export any of my notes as text or markdown files. Ideally I want my documents to be independent of any specific software.
