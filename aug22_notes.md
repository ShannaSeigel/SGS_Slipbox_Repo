Happenings So Far

   202008222204: Just exploring themes rather than really learning anything tonight.
    202008222242: Curious how to get logo working. Or literally any of the theme. Kind of just guessing here.
    202008222258: Going to try the desktop option. Esp b/c GH says their desktop program doesn't use the command line and I have limited command line experience.
