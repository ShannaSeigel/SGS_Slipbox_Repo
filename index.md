title: Hello!

Welcome to my test site, a trial and error experiment in learning how to build modern websites and hosting my ~~ZK/garden/second brain/what-have-you~~ Obsidian vault online.

- I made a [list of rules](docs/new_format_rules.md) I need to follow after being used to Bear or Obsidian links.
- I've got an [experience log](docs/xp_log.md)

## Plans for Slipbox Files
- Need to review incoming files from my existing notes for formatting requirements regarding filenames and links.
- Make sure to maintain this structure going forward.
	- Can use the "relative notes" setting to quickly get file names from wikilinks. Can edit link formatting after.
- Goal to keep list of zettels in a flat, single folder in hopes of reducing broken links.
- Still mulling over how to handle organization, landing page, blog, or anything else I'd like to add.
