## SGS_Slipbox_Repo
## Shanna's Repository for my ZK/Knowledge Base

Reference for self with a log of my findings. I have basically no recent/relevant experience with website building and am trying the probably harder but free route instead of a website building platform.

### What have I been up to? What have I learned? (Aug 22/23)

- Created Obsidian vault just from this folder as the root folder that will be shared to GitHub.
- Made a [reference](new_format_rules.md) of tips to keep in mind to transition from my usual markdown workflow to writing with the intent of hosting content online.
	- Mainly linking and file names.
- Spent time testing out how to correctly create links between .md files.
	- Able to see different types of links in my Obsidian graph that don't translate to links in GH Pages.
		- `[zk note test](202008231210 zk note.md)` worked fine but the filename has spaces. Immediately broke rule #1 I made myself.
- Spent like four hours trying to solve a problem I didn't need to solve.
	- Wanted to try a private repository hosted to Netlify. I got as far as installing Homebrew, Ruby, etc. before Jekyll just would not install for me and I gave up. I was following tutorials but since I don't normally use the command line I really had no idea what I was doing.
	- Really no reason to have a private repository and add the extra steps of using a service outside of GitHub, I just wanted to learn more.
		- Forgot another plan I had for myself: **keep it simple, get fancy later.** 
- Now just trying to clear out all my scrap notes and test files.
- For f's sake. After so much link testing now suddenly I don't need `folder_name/filename.md` in links that aren't in my root folder? I absolutely did earlier. Which is right?
	- Oh, I think the two files, this one and the format rules, are in the same folder and don't need the folder name ahead of them? URL was showing `foldername/foldername/filename.md`
	- All the more reason not to have any folder structure I guess.
- How in the holy hell did I spend so long just trying to add an image and a caption. What is this shit? Like text gets stuck to the previous line somehow and doesn't want to cooperate with me?
	- Guess I'm glad I deleted my earlier notes full of F-bombs.
