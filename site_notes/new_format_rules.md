## Format Requirements for Web Sharing
1. File names MUST be a single string with no spaces in order to create links.


2. Wikilinks `[[notes with double brackets]]` are not a standard markdown tool.
	- Use classic link format with `[anchor text](link location)`

3. REMEMBER NOT TO MOVE/RENAME folders or files unless I plan to update all links. Obsidian will auto update links for wikilinks but NOT classic/normal link format.


## Plan for SGS_Slipbox Files
- Need to review incoming files from my existing notes for above requirements regarding filenames and links.
- Make sure to maintain this structure going forward.
	- Use the "relative notes" setting to quickly get file names from wikilinks. Can edit link formatting after.
- Goal to keep list of zettels in a flat, single folder in hopes of reducing broken links.
- Non-knowledge-base files can live in another folder for easy access.
- Still mulling over how to handle organization, landing page, blog, or anything else I'd like to add.
