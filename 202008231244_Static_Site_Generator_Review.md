Reading jekyll vs gatsby and i think gatsby is far too much for me right now. if everything is a markdown file then maybe i can eventually migrate if needed. nice things on web-app gatsby style from this page: https://mathieudutour.github.io/gatsby-digital-garden/?stackedPages=%2FGatsby

has a graph, has a dark mode. i'm guess thats not a thing in jekyll.

is that the "graphQL" thing?
graphql plug in for jekyll example:

if i ever need it for a graph of my site?

reading about jk+urls, never considered any of this. thought it would mirror my folder and be done.

didnt finish reading just now. i think this will be important if/when i decide about blogging. BUT if i use an existing theme maybe those settings will be set up for me??

helpful reading pointing to jekyll for me for static site given others have a steeper learning curve (gatsby, hugo)

why are they all literary names?

other reasons why good match for me right now
