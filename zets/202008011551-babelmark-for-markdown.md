[Babelmark](https://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2/) is a tool for comparing output of [markdown](../mocs/ðŸŸ£MARKDOWN.md) for plain text documents. Can copy+paste text directly into the tool.

**Aug 2020:**
Tried copying some random text from Bear and it was mildly interesting to see how the text was rendered in different languages.
