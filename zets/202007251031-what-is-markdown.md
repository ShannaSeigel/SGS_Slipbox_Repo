Developed in 2004, many variations of markdown language exist. Developer John Gruber has an overview of markdown on his website [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#overview)

It is possible to convert between variations or markdown, for example with ❓Zettelkasten/202008021358 Pandoc for .md|Pandoc
