### What is CommonMark and why use it?

- Original [markdown](../mocs/ðŸŸ£MARKDOWN.md) was not perfect, created bugs, and hasnâ€™t been updated since 2004 (source: https://commonmark.org)
- Over the following decade people came up with many iterations of markdown
	- leads to documents that render differently in one system vs another, like [GitHub](202008011612-github-flavored-markdown.md) vs [Pandoc](202008021358-pandoc-program.md)
	- No standard test reference
		- [mdTest](202008010550-mdtest.md) can provide testing of .md implementations
		-  [Babelmark](202008011551-babelmark-for-markdown.md) can compare output of 20+ flavors of .md and see if thereâ€™s a consensus result.

CommonMark aims to have a

> <ins>standard, unambiguous syntax specification for Markdown</ins>, along with a <ins>suite of comprehensive tests</ins> to validate Markdown implementations against this specification.

Several implementations of CommonMark exist, including:
- GitHub/GitLab
- Reddit
- Stack Overflow
